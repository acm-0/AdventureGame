You can create your own adventure game using this game engine!

The game data is stored in the form of a JSON file. If you are not
familiar with the syntax of JSON, it is very straightforward, there
is plenty of documentation on line.

There are five main sections to the JSON adventure file:
Attributes
Objects
Rooms
Subroutines
Textstrings
