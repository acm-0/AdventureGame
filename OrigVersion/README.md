# AdventureGame
This is a game engine and demo game for a classic text-based adventure game
such as Zork.

The game engine is written in Python, I wrote it as an exercise to teach myself Python.

The game data is stored as a JSON file.  This file has its own syntax, documented separately.
This will allow people to create there own advnture games without modifying the game engine.

File included in this project:
- AdventureBaseClass.py -- the main game engine
- AdventureCustomClass.py -- a file where you can add custom code for custom game
  features without having to modify the base game engine
- adventure.json -- the data file that holds all the game date
- adventure.py -- The top level game
- sounds/ -- a directory that holds audio clips that can be optionally used in the game
- documentation/README.GameData
