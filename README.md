This Python program provides the structure for writing Adventure game programs.  
Adventure games are a classic form of computer games from the 1970s and 80s.   
They are text based, and involve you the character moving from place to place
in the adventure world, solving puzzles and problems on the way to achieving
some quesst.

Here we use a .json file to contain all the elements of the game - the rooms,
items, actions, directions to travel, etc.  Thus the creator of an adventure 
game only needs to create the database for the game as a .json file, and does
not have to write any code.

Eventually I will create documentation for how to code the .json file.  For now,
in the unikely event that someone reads this and would like to try to create
their own game, send me a note and I will explain how to do it.
